<h1>Biological related Projects</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A series of “mini-projects” / exercises related to solving problems and recurring events in biology.

Some of these were inspired by Dr. Martin Jones' books such as “Advanced Python for Biologists” and my university experiences. All the exercises/projects you will find have been modified from the originals to adapt them to personal needs.

Among the projects you will find, we will address issues related to the evolution of genes within a population based on their fitness, algorithms for searching for patterns within DNA sequences and much more.

I hope you find this material inspiring, happy bioinformatics to all 😄🔬🌱🐧
