<h1>Biological related Projects</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
A series of “mini-projects” / exercises related to solving problems and recurring events in biology, especially exploiting functions, classes and methods provided by Biopython.

Some of these projects were inspired by my university experiences. All the exercises/projects you will find have been modified from the originals to adapt them to personal needs.

Among the projects you will find, we will address issues related to creation of a phylogenetic tree....
I hope you find this material inspiring, happy bioinformatics to all 😄🔬🌱🐧
